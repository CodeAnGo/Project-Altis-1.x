Looney Labs: 
1. Constant Nighttime
2. Surelee's Observatory can be on a hill with a telescope pointed towards the sky
3. Looney Labs would be on the lower ground, it'd be a big research facility basically
4. The main area would be a tooney town
5. Sky would have a constant aurora 
6. There'd be an indoor garden (for science)!
7. Possibly on a canyon with platforms, because it is an observatory and needs to be high up
